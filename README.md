## Project Overview
This project aims to retrieve, analyze, and process options trading data within the context of the Indian financial markets. The primary objective is to develop Python functions that fetch option chain data for specific instruments, calculate margin requirements, and compute premiums based on bid and ask prices. This data-centric approach focuses on data handling and API integration, making it accessible even to those without prior financial expertise.

## Functionality
The project includes the following main functionalities:
1. Retrieve option chain data for specified instruments.
2. Calculate margin requirements and premium earned for options trading.
3. Filter data based on user-defined criteria (e.g., instrument name, expiry date, and option type).
4. Save processed data to CSV files for easy analysis and reporting.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Required Libraries:
  - Flask
  - requests
  - pandas
  - nsepython
- Upstox API credentials (API key, API secret)

## API Integration
The project integrates with the Upstox API to fetch user profile data and options chain data. The following key endpoints are utilized:
- **Login and Authentication**: Fetches authorization codes and exchanges them for access tokens.
- **User Profile**: Retrieves user profile information to check for margin permissions.
- **Options Chain Data**: Scrapes option chain data using the `nsepython` library.

## Functions Overview
### 1. `get_all_option_chain_data(instruments: list) -> pd.DataFrame`
Fetches and compiles option chain data for the specified instruments. Returns a DataFrame containing details for both Put Options (PE) and Call Options (CE).

### 2. `fetch_margin_requirement(instrument_name, strike_price, side)`
Returns a simulated margin requirement based on the type of option (PE or CE). Placeholder values are used due to limited access to actual margin data.

### 3. `calculate_margin_and_premium(data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame`
Calculates margin requirements and premiums earned for each option in the provided DataFrame. The lot size is set to 75, following the revised NIFTY lot size.

### 4. `filter_data_for_example(data: pd.DataFrame, instrument: str, expiry_date: str, sides: list) -> pd.DataFrame`
Filters the DataFrame to return only the data matching specified instrument, expiry date, and option types.

## Usage
1. **API Setup**:
   - Replace `api_key` and `api_secret` in the code with your Upstox API credentials.
   - Run the Flask application to set up a local server for authorization callback.

2. **Fetching Data**:
   - Define the list of instruments to fetch data for (e.g., `['NIFTY', 'BANKNIFTY']`).
   - Call `get_all_option_chain_data(instruments)` to retrieve option chain data.

3. **Calculating Margin and Premium**:
   - Pass the DataFrame returned from the previous step to `calculate_margin_and_premium(data)`.

4. **Filtering Data**:
   - Use `filter_data_for_example(result, example_instrument, example_expiry_date, example_sides)` to filter data based on specific criteria.

5. **Saving Data**:
   - Save the results to CSV files using `save_to_csv()` functions (ensure the function is defined in your code).


## Error Handling
Implement error handling for API responses, including:
- Handling missing data or invalid responses from the API.
- Validating input parameters for functions to ensure correct usage.

## AI Assistance
- Leveraged AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for generating code snippets, understanding API documentation, and clarifying financial concepts.
- Documented AI-assisted steps include:
  - Generating function skeletons for API data retrieval.
  - Seeking explanations for margin requirements and options trading.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a foundational framework for analyzing options trading data in the Indian financial markets. By focusing on data processing and API integration, it provides a scalable approach to enhance trading strategies and insights without requiring in-depth financial knowledge.
